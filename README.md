# STM32F411RE-I2C-EEPROM-RTC-DS1307-Interface-Project
This project demonstrates interfacing the HW-111 module containing AT24C32 EEPROM and DS1307 RTC with an STM32 Nucleo-F411RE board using I2C communication.   The system continuously prints the real-time clock output via UART to PuTTY serial terminal.
